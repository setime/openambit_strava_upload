# Openambit Upload to Strava

This is a script to copy files form openambit to a second folder, convert these files and upload the to strava. A token Strava is needed.

**Remark: Probably the best way would be to update Openambit, but this was a bit faster.**

```bash
python main.py -h
```

See help for command line arguments.
